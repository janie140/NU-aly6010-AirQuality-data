# NU-aly6010-AirQuality-data

Introduction 

The provided “airquality” dataset consists of 153 rows and 6 columns (variables): Ozone (mean Ozone concentration), Solar.R (Solar radiation), Wind (average wind speed), Temp (maximum daily temperature), Month (Month of observation), and Day of the month.

The ozone boxplot by month shows several outliers mostly in September, and the largest IQR in August. The wind boxplot by month illustrates the close similarity of IQR in all 5 months and the lowest median wind value in July.

There is a strong negative correlation between Ozone concentration and average wind speed. Meanwhile, the Ozone index has a strong positive relationship with the daily temperature over these months.
